#StudentDaily - 学生日报app

##Notice

This project is discontinued.


##Introduction

“StudentDaily” is an iOS news app. I built this to solve public account problems in Wechat users.

Wechat(微信) is a social network app that connects people. It has almost 0.6 billion users all around the world. Besides traditional text, voice or video chat, Wechat provides an Official Public Account Platform that allows personal users or media to post news there for subscription. The problem is that there is no way for readers to read all posts at one time from different public accounts. The readers will have to visit an account and read all news, and switch to another account. Also, among millions of the public accounts, it is difficult to find those with values. Moreover, Wechat has not open APIs for search engines, and there are no stable URLs for posts of these accounts, causing tremendous troubles in scrapping.

##Hightlight

- Self-developed side menu (using wide `UIScrollView`)
- Scrolling difference effect in the top banner
- Combination of `UIWebView` and `UIScrollView` (Like "知乎日报 app")- Self-developed Javascript tool convert inline-styled HTML into plain text
